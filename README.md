# Iterative Inference
Implementation of iterative inference in deep latent variable models

# To-do
- [ ] Figure out why we're using GPU0. Suspect it's from the data loader.
- [ ] Recurrent encoding networks.
- [ ] Direct gradient encoding.
- [ ] Multiple samples/estimates.
- [ ] Convolutional model.
- [ ] Normalizing flows and IAF.
- [ ] Random re-initialization of modules during training.


# Visualization to-do
- [ ] Visualize errors at the input level and reconstructions over inference iterations.
- [ ] Latent traversal of lowest variance dimensions.
- [ ] Plot number of inactive units.
- [ ] 2D latent visualization.
